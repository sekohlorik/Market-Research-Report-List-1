<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intelligent CTG Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>External Cardiotocography</li><li>Internal Cardiotocography</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Intelligent CTG market is primarily divided into two types: external cardiotocography and internal cardiotocography. External cardiotocography involves the use of non-invasive sensors placed on the motherâ€™s abdomen to monitor fetal heart rate and uterine contractions. In contrast, internal cardiotocography requires the insertion of a thin electrode directly onto the fetal scalp for more precise monitoring. Both methods are crucial for assessing fetal well-being during labor, but they differ in their techniques, accuracy, and level of invasiveness.</p></p>
