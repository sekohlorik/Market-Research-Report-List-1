<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The NICU Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The NICU ventilators market is divided into two main types: invasive and non-invasive ventilation. Invasive ventilators involve the use of endotracheal tubes or tracheostomy for delivering respiratory support directly into the patient's airway. They are typically used for critically ill neonates requiring full respiratory support. Non-invasive ventilators, on the other hand, use methods like CPAP or BiPAP masks to provide respiratory assistance while minimizing discomfort and complications associated with invasive techniques. Both types are vital for effectively managing neonatal respiratory conditions.</p></p>
